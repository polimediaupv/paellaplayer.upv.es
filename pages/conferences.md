	As per Opencast 4.0, Paella Player is a popular option in many deployments. In this talk we will address the status
	of the current release and the new features of the player.

	Then we will comment on the changes we are addressing to ease the usage of Paella within Opencast, the recent license
	change and the pull request(s) for including the bindings in the OC source code.

	Finally we will describe the roadmap of the next release of Paella, and also the plans for further development of 
	those bindings. I'll expect comments from the community within the allocated time

### Opencast Summit 2016 (University of Cologne)

* [Paella Player 5]({{player_url}}?id=opencast-2016-paella5) (Carlos Turro)
	
	Paella player is a multistream player designed with Opencast in mind. Paella works with all HTML5 browsers 
	(Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE9 and 10),iPad and Android phones, and supports also live streaming.

	Since 2012 Paella has had several releases, each with new features. In release 5 we are working on adding several improvements,
	being the most important the MPEG-Dash video format support and a first working release towards annotations. 
	In the presentation we will present the new features and architectural changes of paella, and also we will present our ideas 
	in supporting annotations and other kind of related content (quizzes?, external pages?) inside of the video player.

	In the presentation we will have a look on paella architecture and features, and then we will move on to the strategy 
	and plans that we have for future releases. The scope of the talk will be general, with no (or little) code involved.
	I will have also some time for an open talk on with features should support a media player for lecture recordings.
