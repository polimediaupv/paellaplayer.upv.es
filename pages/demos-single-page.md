# Demos on single page

The same examples are available on this page as on the [demos page](#/demos), but all included on a single page. This is an example of paella-core's new capabilities for working with multiple instances of a player on a single page.

Please note that this is an experimental feature. Loading more than one player on the same page simultaneously may cause memory issues, especially on more resource-constrained platforms such as smartphones.
