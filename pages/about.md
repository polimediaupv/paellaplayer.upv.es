# Opencast Support

Paella Player works BOTH as an standalone JavaScript player and as an [Opencast](http://opencast.org/) video player. So:
  - If you are using Opencast >5.0 you have already Paella in your system. 
  - If you have an old Opencast version you should use the [paella-opencast](https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella-opencast) project
