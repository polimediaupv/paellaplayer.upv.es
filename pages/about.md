ABOUT
=========

The Paella `(pronounced 'paeja')` Player is a HTML5 multistream video player capable of 
playing multiple audio & video streams synchronously and supporting a number of user plugins. 
It is specially designed for lecture recordings, like Opencast Lectures or Polimedia pills.

By using Paella:

*	Students can view both the lecture hall and the teacher's screen, get info 
	about the lecture (slides, OCR, series videos, footprints) and interact with the lecture
	(views, comments).
*	Teachers can also soft edit the lecture to set the start and end point or make breaks 
	in the recording. 


You can take your first contact with Paella looking at the next video, or by going to our [demo page](demos.md).

Paella works with all HTML5 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) and in iPad and Android phones. Paella uses Adobe Flash as a fallback method in case that your browser can not play the video files.
