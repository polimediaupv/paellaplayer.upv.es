# Upgrading from paella 6.2.x to 6.3.x

In principle it should not be necessary to modify anything to upgrade to version 6.3.x. However, video360 videos, which were an unsupported test feature in previous version, are now supported in Paella 6.3.x, but are defined using the new videoCanvas feature.

- Video360 streams no longer exist. Instead, a normal video stream is used (currently mp4 and hls streams are implemented).
- For the video to be represented with the 360ยบ viewer, a 'video360' canvas is used for the equirectangular format, and 'video360theta' for the raw format of the Ricoh Theta S camera.
